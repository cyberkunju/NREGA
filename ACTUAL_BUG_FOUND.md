# üêõ Actual Bug Found and Fixed!

## The Real Problem

The issue was **NOT** that Kolkata was mapped to Soreng. The real issue was:

### Root Cause: Fuzzy Matching Gone Wrong

1. **Kolkata doesn't exist in the government API data** - The MGNREGA API simply doesn't have data for Kolkata district
2. **Fuzzy matching was too aggressive** - When Kolkata (from GeoJSON) couldn't find a match, the fuzzy matching algorithm incorrectly matched it to "Soreng"
3. **Wrong data displayed** - Instead of showing "No Data", Kolkata was showing Soreng's data

## What Was Wrong

```javascript
// Strategy 3: Fuzzy matching (THE BUG!)
if (!perfData) {
  const bestMatch = findBestMatch(districtNameRaw, stateNameRaw, ...);
  if (bestMatch) {
    perfData = dataLookup[bestMatch];  // ‚Üê Kolkata matched to Soreng!
  }
}
```

The fuzzy matching was finding "Soreng" as the "best match" for "Kolkata" which is completely wrong!

## The Fix

**Disabled fuzzy matching entirely** - Better to show no data than wrong data:

```javascript
// Strategy 3: Fuzzy matching DISABLED
// The fuzzy matching was causing Kolkata to match with Soreng
// Better to show no data than wrong data
// (commented out the fuzzy matching code)
```

## Why Kolkata Has No Data

Kolkata is NOT in the government's MGNREGA API. Here's proof:

**Districts in API for West Bengal** (23 districts):
- 24 Parganas (north)
- 24 Parganas South
- Alipurduar
- Bankura
- Birbhum
- Coochbehar
- Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (dghc)
- Dinajpur Dakshin
- Dinajpur Uttar
- Hooghly
- Howrah
- Jalpaiguri
- Jhargram
- Kalimpong
- Maldah
- Murshidabad
- Nadia
- Paschim Bardhaman
- Paschim Medinipur
- Purba Bardhaman
- Purba Medinipur
- Purulia
- Siliguri Mahakuma Parisad

**Kolkata is missing!** This is because Kolkata is a metropolitan city and may not have MGNREGA schemes (MGNREGA is primarily for rural employment).

## What Will Happen Now

### Before Fix:
- Kolkata ‚Üí Shows Soreng data ‚ùå (WRONG!)
- Other unmapped districts ‚Üí Show random wrong data ‚ùå

### After Fix:
- Kolkata ‚Üí Shows gray (no data) ‚úÖ (CORRECT!)
- Other unmapped districts ‚Üí Show gray (no data) ‚úÖ (CORRECT!)
- Sikkim districts ‚Üí Show correct data ‚úÖ (via perfect mapping)
- All other mapped districts ‚Üí Show correct data ‚úÖ

## The Perfect Mapping Still Helps!

The perfect mapping file we created is still valuable because:

1. **Sikkim districts work correctly** - Maps district names to direction names
2. **West Bengal districts work** - Maps 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, etc.
3. **Bangalore variants work** - Maps Bengaluru/Bangalore correctly
4. **95.7% coverage** - 731 out of 745 API districts mapped correctly
5. **No more wrong matches** - Fuzzy matching disabled prevents incorrect data display

## Test Results Expected

### Kolkata:
- **Before**: Showed Soreng data (100% payment, 5,386 households)
- **After**: Shows gray (no data available)
- **Why**: Kolkata doesn't exist in MGNREGA API (it's a metro city)

### Sikkim Districts:
- **Before**: All gray (no data)
- **After**: All show correct data
- **Why**: Perfect mapping maps district names to direction names

### Other Districts:
- **Before**: Some showed wrong data due to fuzzy matching
- **After**: Show correct data or gray (no wrong data)

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Disabled fuzzy matching to prevent wrong data display
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Sikkim districts now map correctly (via perfect mapping)
‚úÖ **Fixed**: West Bengal districts map correctly
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Bangalore variants map correctly
‚úÖ **Clarified**: Kolkata has no data because it's not in the government API

The application will now show **correct data or no data**, but never **wrong data**!

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Key Change**: Disabled fuzzy matching in MapView.jsx
