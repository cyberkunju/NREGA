# ⚠️ CLEAR BROWSER CACHE REQUIRED!

## The Fix Was Applied But You Need To:

### 1. Hard Refresh Your Browser
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 2. Or Clear Cache Manually
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 3. Or Clear All Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Clear storage"
4. Click "Clear site data"

## Why?

The React app is cached in your browser. The fix was applied to the code, but your browser is still using the old cached version.

## What Should Happen After Cache Clear?

Districts like:
- KEONJHAR (KENDUJHAR)
- BALASORE (BALESHWAR)
- BAUDH (BAUDA)
- PURBA MEDINIPUR
- And many West Bengal districts

Should change from **WHITE** to **COLORED** (showing their data).
