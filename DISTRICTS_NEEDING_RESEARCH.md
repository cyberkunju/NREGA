## Category 3: Mystery Districts (12 districts)

These are showing on the map (part of the 713) but we don't know which ones they are. They're being matched by fuzzy fallback and might be WRONG.

**We need to identify these 12 districts by checking the map!**

Expected: 693 (perfect) + 8 (uncertain) = 701
Actual: 713
Mystery: 713 - 701 = 12

**Action Required:**
1. Check the browser console for which districts are using "Fallback" match
2. List them here
3. Verify if they're showing correct data

---

## How to Research

### For Each District:

1. **Google Search:** "[District Name] [State Name] India"
2. **Check Wikipedia:** Look for official district information
3. **Census of India:** https://censusindia.gov.in/
4. **Check GeoJSON:** Search in `frontend/public/india-districts.geojson`
5. **Verify State:** Make sure the district is in the correct state!

### Common Issues to Watch For:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Wrong State:** API might have district in wrong state (e.g., Narmadapuram in Gujarat instead of MP)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Renamed Districts:** Old name in GeoJSON, new name in API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Spelling Variations:** Beed/Bid, Neemuch/Nimach, etc.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **New Districts:** Created after 2018 might not be in GeoJSON
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Merged Districts:** Some districts were merged or split

### How to Find geoId:

```bash
# Search in GeoJSON file
grep -i "district_name" frontend/public/india-districts.geojson
```

Or open the file and search for the district name, then find the "id" property.

---

## Submission Format

Once you've researched all districts, please provide:

```
District: [API Name], [API State]
Correct GeoJSON: [GeoJSON Name]
GeoId: [number]
Notes: [Any additional information]
Action: [ADD_TO_MAPPING / EXCLUDE / ALREADY_MAPPED]
```

---

## Summary

**Total Districts Needing Research: 50**
- 8 Uncertain fallback matches
- 34 New districts (might be in GeoJSON with different names)
- 8 Already identified as wrong state

**Priority:**
1. HIGH: Districts 1-8 (uncertain fallback - might be showing wrong data NOW)
2. MEDIUM: Districts 9-42 (new districts - not showing, but could be added)
3. LOW: Mystery 12 districts (need to identify first)

**Goal:** 100% accuracy with maximum coverage!
