# Andaman & Nicobar "No Data" - This is CORRECT!

## What You're Seeing

When you hover over **North & Middle Andaman**, the tooltip shows:
```
NORTH & MIDDLE ANDAMAN
ANDAMAN & NICOBAR

Payment Timeliness: No data
```

## Why This Happens

### âœ… This is CORRECT Behavior!

The map is working perfectly. Here's why:

1. **Mapping is Correct**
   - âœ… GeoJSON has the district boundary
   - âœ… Mapping file links API â†’ GeoJSON correctly
   - âœ… District name normalization works

2. **API Has NO DATA**
   - The government API (data.gov.in) currently has **0 records** for Andaman & Nicobar
   - This is not a bug - it's reality!
   - The API simply doesn't have MGNREGA data for these islands

## Verification

### Check 1: Mapping Exists âœ…
```javascript
"andaman and nicobar:north and middle andaman": {
  "geoDistrict": "NORTH & MIDDLE ANDAMAN",
  "geoState": "ANDAMAN & NICOBAR",
  "geoId": 571,
  "confidence": 1
}
```

### Check 2: API Query Returns 0 Records âœ…
```
GET https://api.data.gov.in/.../filters[state]=ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR
Response: { "total": 0, "count": 0, "records": [] }
```

### Check 3: all-districts-statewise.txt Lists It âœ…
```
1. ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR = NICOBARS, NORTH AND MIDDLE ANDAMAN, SOUTH ANDAMAN
   (3 districts)
```

## Why No Data?

Possible reasons the API has no data for Andaman & Nicobar:

1. **Remote Location**: Islands are remote, data collection may be limited
2. **Small Population**: Very few MGNREGA beneficiaries
3. **Data Not Uploaded**: Local authorities haven't uploaded data yet
4. **Excluded from Scheme**: MGNREGA may not be active in these islands
5. **API Lag**: Data exists but not yet in the API

## What This Means

### For Your Map:
- âœ… **Working correctly** - showing "No data" when API has no data
- âœ… **Boundary visible** - district shows on map (not white/missing)
- âœ… **Proper mapping** - API key correctly links to GeoJSON
- âœ… **User experience** - Clear "No data" message

### For Users:
- They can see the district exists
- They understand there's no data available
- They can still explore other metrics/time periods
- The map doesn't break or show errors

## Other Districts with No Data

You might also see "No data" for:
- **Lakshadweep** (excluded from mapping - no boundary data)
- Some **newly created districts** (data not yet available)
- **Remote areas** with limited data collection

## Conclusion

**This is NOT a bug!** ðŸŽ¯

Your map is correctly showing "No data" because:
1. âœ… The mapping is correct
2. âœ… The API genuinely has no data
3. âœ… The user experience is clear
4. âœ… The district is visible on the map

If the government uploads data for Andaman & Nicobar in the future, your map will automatically show it - no code changes needed!

**Status**: âœ… Working as expected  
**Action needed**: None - this is correct behavior  
**User impact**: Minimal - clear "No data" message
