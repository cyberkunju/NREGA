# Quick Test Guide - Hexagonal Districts Fix

## What Was Fixed

The 5 weird hexagonal/octagonal districts in Chhattisgarh are now **hidden** from the map:

1. ‚úÖ MANENDRAGARH CHIRMIRI BHARATPUR
2. ‚úÖ SAKTI
3. ‚úÖ MOHLA MANPUR AMBAGARH CHOWKI
4. ‚úÖ KHAIRAGARH CHHUIKHADAN GANDAI
5. ‚úÖ SARANGARH BILAIGARH

## How to Test

### Step 1: Wait for Docker to Start

Docker is currently starting up. Wait until you see:
```
‚úî Container mgnrega-frontend  Started
```

### Step 2: Open the Application

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

**IMPORTANT:** Your browser caches the old GeoJSON file!

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"

**Or do a hard refresh:**
- `Ctrl+F5` (Windows)
- `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Step 4: Navigate to Chhattisgarh

1. The map will load showing all of India
2. Zoom in to central India
3. Look for Chhattisgarh state (center-right of India)
4. Zoom in closer to see the districts

### Step 5: Verify the Fix

**What you should see:**
- ‚úÖ Surrounding districts show normally (Raigarh, Bilaspur, Janjgir-Champa, etc.)
- ‚úÖ NO hexagonal/octagonal shapes visible
- ‚úÖ Clean, professional appearance
- ‚úÖ No weird dark overlapping districts

**What you should NOT see:**
- ‚ùå Dark hexagonal shapes
- ‚ùå Octagonal districts
- ‚ùå Overlapping weird geometries
- ‚ùå Districts with only 9 points

### Step 6: Check Console (Optional)

Open browser console (`F12`) and look for:
```
‚úÖ Layers added successfully
```

No errors should appear related to the placeholder districts.

## Expected Result

**Before Fix:**
```
[Dark hexagon] MANENDRAGARH CHIRMIRI BHARATPUR
[Dark hexagon] SAKTI
[Dark hexagon] MOHLA MANPUR AMBAGARH CHOWKI
[Dark hexagon] KHAIRAGARH CHHUIKHADAN GANDAI
[Dark hexagon] SARANGARH BILAIGARH
```

**After Fix:**
```
[Invisible] - These 5 districts are completely hidden
[Normal] Raigarh - Shows normally
[Normal] Bilaspur - Shows normally
[Normal] Janjgir-Champa - Shows normally
[Normal] All other districts - Show normally
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing hexagons

**Solution:** Clear browser cache
```
Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Clear cached images and files
```

### Issue: Map not loading

**Solution:** Check Docker status
```bash
docker ps
```

Should show 4 containers running:
- mgnrega-frontend
- mgnrega-api
- mgnrega-etl
- mgnrega-db

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use

**Solution:** Stop other processes on port 3000
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change port in docker-compose.yml
```

### Issue: Changes not visible

**Solution:** Rebuild Docker containers
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

## What Changed in Code

File: `frontend/src/components/IndiaDistrictMap/MapView.jsx`

Added placeholder district filter to all layers:
- Heatmap layer: `fill-opacity: 0`
- Background layer: `fill-opacity: 0`
- Border layer: `line-opacity: 0`
- Label layer: `text-opacity: 0`

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ No hexagonal districts visible in Chhattisgarh  
‚úÖ Surrounding districts show normally  
‚úÖ Map looks clean and professional  
‚úÖ No console errors  
‚úÖ Tooltips work for visible districts  

## Next Steps

Once you verify the fix works:

1. **If satisfied:** The fix is complete! ‚úÖ
2. **If you want real boundaries:** See `DOWNLOAD_REAL_BOUNDARIES.md`
3. **If issues:** Check `FIX_HEXAGONAL_DISTRICTS.md` for alternatives

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check Docker status
docker ps

# View frontend logs
docker logs mgnrega-frontend

# Restart Docker
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild everything
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build

# Stop Docker
docker-compose down
```
