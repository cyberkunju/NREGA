## Common Issues Identified

### Issue 1: WRONG STATES IN API (Most Critical!)

**6 districts are in completely different states:**

| District | API State | Correct State | Impact |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Narmadapuram | Gujarat | Madhya Pradesh | Data shows wrong location |
| Chatrapati Sambhaji | Jharkhand | Maharashtra | Data shows wrong location |
| Dharashiv | Madhya Pradesh | Maharashtra | Data shows wrong location |
| Jayashankar | Madhya Pradesh | Telangana | Data shows wrong location |
| Siddharth Nagar | Madhya Pradesh | Uttar Pradesh | Data shows wrong location |
| Unakoti | Himachal Pradesh | Tripura | Data shows wrong location |

**Root Cause:**
- Data entry errors in the MGNREGA API
- Manual input mistakes
- Outdated information not corrected after state/district changes

**Impact on Map:**
- These districts are currently showing MGNREGA data in WRONG locations
- Users see incorrect employment data for wrong geographic areas
- Map visualization is inaccurate

---

### Issue 2: RENAMED DISTRICTS (Post-2021 Changes)

**3 districts officially renamed in 2022-2023:**

| District | Old Name | New Name | Year |
|----------|----------|----------|------|
| Hoshangabad | Hoshangabad | Narmadapuram | 2022 |
| Aurangabad | Aurangabad | Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar | 2023 |
| Osmanabad | Osmanabad | Dharashiv | 2023 |

**Issue:**
- GeoJSON has old names
- API may have new names
- Creating mismatch in district matching

**Resolution:**
- Map new names to old GeoJSON names
- Use GeoJSON IDs to ensure accuracy
- Update reference data as GeoJSON is updated

---

### Issue 3: SPELLING VARIATIONS

**5 districts with multiple valid spellings:**

| District | API Spelling | GeoJSON Spelling | Cause |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Anantapur | Anantapur | Ananthapuramu | Official name suffix |
| Poonch | Poonch | Punch | Regional pronunciation |
| Dohad | Dohad | Dahod | Transliteration variant |
| Beed | Beed | Bid | Hindi-English variation |
| Narsinghpur | Narsinghpur | Narshimapura | Transliteration variant |

**Root Cause:**
- Hindi-English transliteration differences
- Regional naming conventions
- Multiple spellings used in official documents

**Resolution:**
- Create lookup table with all spelling variants
- Map API names to canonical GeoJSON names
- Add validation for common spelling variations

---

### Issue 4: HISTORICAL ADMINISTRATIVE NAMES

**2 districts use historical region names in GeoJSON:**

| District | Modern Name | Historical Name | Region |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Khargone | Khargone | West Nimar | Between Narmada and Tapti rivers |
| Khandwa | Khandwa | East Nimar | Between Narmada and Tapti rivers |

**Context:**
- "Nimar" = land between two rivers (historical administrative region)
- Modern district names are Khargone and Khandwa
- GeoJSON uses old historical administrative names

**Resolution:**
- Map modern names to historical GeoJSON names
- Document this mapping for future reference
- Be aware when dealing with other "Nimar" references

---

### Issue 5: NEW DISTRICTS (2012-2022) NOT IN GEOJSON

**4 districts too new for current GeoJSON:**

| District | State | Created | Source |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| Sarangarh Bilaigarh | Chhattisgarh | Sept 1, 2022 | From Raigarh, Baloda Bazar |
| Unakoti | Tripura | 2012 | From North Tripura |
| Eastern West Khasi Hills | Meghalaya | Nov 10, 2021 | From West Khasi Hills |
| Vijayanagara | Karnataka | 2021 | From Ballari |

**Issue:**
- Created after GeoJSON was last updated
- Don't exist in map file
- Will cause errors if matching against GeoJSON

**Resolution:**
- Exclude from current mapping
- Maintain separate list for future updates
- Plan for GeoJSON updates as new districts are added
- Consider how to handle MGNREGA data for these districts

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Immediate Actions (Wrong State Fixes)

Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL

These 6 districts are currently showing wrong data on your map. Fix immediately:

**Action Items:**
1. Update database state field for 6 districts
2. Run validation to ensure changes propagate
3. Test map to verify districts appear in correct locations

**Code Logic Example:**
```
// Mapping corrections
const stateCorrections = {
  "narmadapuram|gujarat": "madhya_pradesh",
  "chatrapati_sambhaji_nagar|jharkhand": "maharashtra",
  "dharashiv|madhya_pradesh": "maharashtra",
  "jayashankar|madhya_pradesh": "telangana",
  "siddharth_nagar|madhya_pradesh": "uttar_pradesh",
  "unakoti|himachal_pradesh": "tripura"  // EXCLUDE
};
```

---

### Step 2: Name Mapping Updates (Priority 2)

Priority: 🟠 HIGH

Update your district name mapping logic:

**Action Items:**
1. Create lookup table (API name → GeoJSON name)
2. Implement case-insensitive matching
3. Add fallback for spelling variations
4. Map to GeoJSON IDs for validation

**Lookup Table:**
```
API Name → GeoJSON Name (ID)

Narmadapuram → HOSHANGABAD (245)
Chatrapati Sambhaji Nagar → AURANGABAAD (181)
Dharashiv → USMANABAD (143)
Jayashankar Bhopalapally → JAYASHANKAR BHUPALAPALLY (629)
Siddharth Nagar → SIDDHARTHNAGAR (447)
Anantapur → ANANTHAPURAMU (94)
Kawardha → KABIRDHAM (227)
Dohad → DAHOD (269)
Poonch → PUNCH (641)
Beed → BID (158)
Khandwa → EAST NIMAR (226)
Khargone → WEST NIMAR (230)
Narsinghpur → NARSHIMAPURA (254)
```

---

### Step 3: Exclude New Districts (Priority 3)

Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM

Handle districts not in current GeoJSON:

**Action Items:**
1. Add filter to exclude: Sarangarh Bilaigarh, Unakoti, Eastern West Khasi Hills, Vijayanagara
2. Option A: Skip these districts entirely
3. Option B: Create separate handling for new districts
4. Document for future GeoJSON updates

**Code Logic Example:**
```
const newDistrictsToExclude = [
  "sarangarh_bilaigarh",
  "unakoti",
  "eastern_west_khasi_hills",
  "vijayanagara"
];

if (newDistrictsToExclude.includes(districtId)) {
  // Skip or handle separately
  console.warn(`District ${districtId} not in current GeoJSON`);
  return null;
}
```

---

### Step 4: Data Validation & Testing

Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM

Implement validation to prevent future issues:

**Validation Rules:**
1. Every district must have state + name combination
2. State-district pairs must exist in GeoJSON
3. GeoJSON ID must be valid (> 0)
4. No districts should appear in wrong states
5. All name variations should map to canonical names

**Test Cases:**
1. Verify 6 wrong-state districts now show correct locations
2. Verify renamed districts map correctly
3. Verify spelling variations resolve
4. Verify new districts are excluded
5. Spot-check 10 random districts from API

---

### Step 5: Future-Proofing

Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM

Prepare for future district changes:

**Documentation:**
- Keep record of all corrections made
- Document correction date and reason
- Track which corrections are temporary vs. permanent

**Updates:**
- Subscribe to GeoJSON updates
- Monitor new district announcements
- Plan quarterly reference data updates

**Maintenance:**
- Create automated validation tests
- Set up alerts for state mismatches
- Monitor data quality metrics
