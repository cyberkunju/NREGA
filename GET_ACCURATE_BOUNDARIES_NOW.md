# Get Accurate Boundaries - Action Plan

## Current Situation

✅ **Researcher provided 16 GeoJSON files**  
❌ **BUT they're simplified rectangles (9 points each)**  
🎯 **We need accurate boundaries (100-500 points each)**

---

## 🚀 3 Ways to Get Accurate Data

### Method 1: DataMeet (EASIEST) ⭐⭐⭐

**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Success Rate**: 70-80%

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/datameet/maps
2. Download: `india-districts.geojson` or state files
3. Open in text editor
4. Search for district names
5. Copy feature objects
6. Save as individual files

**What you'll get**: Accurate boundaries with 100-500 points

---

### Method 2: Python Script (FASTEST IF YOU HAVE PYTHON) ⭐⭐⭐

**Time**: 10 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy (if Python installed)  
**Success Rate**: 60-70%

**Steps:**
```bash
# Install requirements
pip install geopandas requests

# Run script
python scripts/download_accurate_boundaries.py

# Wait 5-10 minutes for download
# Files will be in accurate_boundaries/ folder
```

**What you'll get**: Accurate boundaries from GADM database

---

### Method 3: OpenStreetMap (MOST COMPLETE) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Success Rate**: 95%+

**Steps for EACH district:**
1. Go to: https://overpass-turbo.eu/
2. Paste query:
```
[out:json][timeout:25];
relation["name"="Malerkotla"]["admin_level"="5"];
out geom;
```
3. Replace "Malerkotla" with district name
4. Click "Run"
5. Click "Export" → "GeoJSON"
6. Save file

**Repeat 16 times** (one per district)

**What you'll get**: Most accurate boundaries available

## 📊 Comparison

| Method | Time | Difficulty | Quality | Coverage |
|--------|------|------------|---------|----------|
| DataMeet | 30 min | ⭐ Easy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 70-80% |
| Python | 10 min | ⭐ Easy* | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 60-70% |
| OpenStreetMap | 2-3 hrs | ⭐⭐ Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 95%+ |

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### Best Approach (Hybrid):

**Step 1**: Try Python script (10 minutes)
```bash
python scripts/download_accurate_boundaries.py
```

**Step 2**: Check what you got
```bash
node scripts/validate-researcher-geojson.js
```

**Step 3**: For missing districts, use OpenStreetMap
- Only need to manually download 4-6 districts
- Takes 30-60 minutes

**Total time**: 1-2 hours for all 16 accurate boundaries

## 🔧 Tools I Created for You

1. **`scripts/download_accurate_boundaries.py`**
   - Automated Python script
   - Downloads from GADM
   - Extracts all 16 districts

2. **`scripts/validate-researcher-geojson.js`**
   - Validates GeoJSON files
   - Checks point count
   - Verifies format

3. **`scripts/integrate-researcher-geojson.js`**
   - Integrates into main map
   - Updates mappings
   - Ready to use

4. **`ACCURATE_BOUNDARY_SOURCES.md`**
   - Detailed guide for each source
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Query templates

---

## ✅ Validation Criteria

**Good boundary** (accept):
- ✅ 100+ coordinate points
- ✅ Actual district shape (not rectangle)
- ✅ File size > 10KB
- ✅ Polygon closes properly

**Bad boundary** (reject):
- ❌ < 20 coordinate points
- ❌ Rectangular shape
- ❌ File size < 5KB
- ❌ Simplified approximation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### If you have Python:
```bash
pip install geopandas requests
python scripts/download_accurate_boundaries.py
# Wait 5-10 minutes
# Check accurate_boundaries/ folder
```

### If you don't have Python:
1. Visit: https://github.com/datameet/maps
2. Download district files
3. Extract the 16 districts
4. Save in research/ folder (replace existing)

### Then:
```bash
node scripts/validate-researcher-geojson.js
# Should show 100+ points per district

node scripts/integrate-researcher-geojson.js
docker-compose restart backend frontend
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```
