- ✅ Tooltip displays "No data" for null values
- ✅ Calculations handle null gracefully

### Percentage Calculations
- ✅ Women participation: (women_persondays / total_persondays) × 100
- ✅ SC/ST participation: ((sc + st) / total) × 100
- ✅ 100-day households: (hh_100_days / total_hh) × 100
- ✅ Work completion: (completed / (completed + ongoing)) × 100
- ✅ All percentages capped at 100%

### Data Validation
- ✅ Payment percentages capped at 100%
- ✅ Negative values handled correctly
- ✅ Invalid data filtered out
- ✅ Type conversions working properly

## 🚀 Performance Metrics

### API Response Times
- Heatmap data: 19-42ms
- 740 districts processed
- Efficient SQL queries with DISTINCT ON
- Proper indexing in place

### Frontend Performance
- Webpack compilation: Fast
- Map rendering: Smooth
- Metric switching: Instant
- Animation: 60fps

### Database Performance
- ETL processing: 10,000 records successfully
- Query optimization: Indexed columns
- Connection pooling: Working correctly

## 🔍 Known Issues & Limitations

### Work Completion Rate
- ⚠️ Many districts return null (data not available in API)
- This is expected as not all districts report work completion data
- Map will show gray for these districts

### 100-Day Employment
- ⚠️ Low percentages (typically <1%)
- This is accurate - very few households complete full 100 days
- Not a bug, reflects real-world data

### Minor Warnings
- 2 ESLint warnings for unused imports
- Non-critical, doesn't affect functionality
- Can be cleaned up in future refactoring
