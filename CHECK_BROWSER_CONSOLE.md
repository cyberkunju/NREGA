# 🔍 Check Browser Console for Debug Info

## What to Do

1. **Open your browser** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Open DevTools** (Press F12)
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
5. **Look for these messages**:

### Expected Console Output:

```
📊 Fallback lookup: XXX keys for 749 districts
📍 Sample lookup keys: [array of keys]
📍 Sample API data: [array of districts]
🔍 GeoJSON: "DISTRICT_NAME" (STATE_NAME)
   Lookup keys: [array]
   Found in dataLookup: [✓ or ✗]
🎯 Match statistics: Perfect=0, Fallback=XXX, None=YYY
📊 Enriched XXX/759 features with data
```

### What the Numbers Mean:

- **Fallback lookup keys**: Should be around 1400-1500 (2 keys per district × 749 districts)
- **Fallback matches**: Should be 600-700 (most districts should match)
- **None**: Should be 50-100 (districts without data)

### If You See:

**✅ Good Signs:**
- "Fallback lookup: 1400+ keys"
- "Match statistics: Fallback=600+"
- "Enriched 600+/759 features"
- Most districts colored (not white/gray)

**❌ Bad Signs:**
- "Fallback lookup: 0 keys" or very low number
- "Match statistics: Fallback=0" or very low
- "Enriched 0/759" or very low
- Most districts white/gray

## Why So Many White Districts?

If you're seeing lots of white districts, it could be:

1. **Browser cache** - The old code is still running
   - Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Or: Clear browser cache and reload

2. **Code not compiled** - React hasn't recompiled the changes
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs frontend`
   - Should see "webpack compiled successfully"

3. **Matching logic issue** - The lookup keys don't match
   - Check console for the debug messages
   - Look at "Found in dataLookup" - should see ✓ marks

## Test Cases to Verify:

### Should Show Data (Colored):
- **Pune, Maharashtra** - Simple name, should match
- **Mumbai Suburban, Maharashtra** - Should match
- **Ahmedabad, Gujarat** - Should match
- **Jaipur, Rajasthan** - Should match

### Should Show Gray (No Data):
- **Kolkata, West Bengal** - Not in API (metro city)
- **Delhi districts** - Not in API (metro area)
- **Chennai, Tamil Nadu** - Not in API (metro city)

### Should Show Data (After Mapping):
- **24 Parganas (North), West Bengal** - Needs mapping
- **Bengaluru Urban, Karnataka** - Needs mapping
- **Sikkim districts** - Need mapping

## Current Status:

✅ **Fuzzy matching**: DISABLED (prevents wrong matches)
✅ **Lookup keys**: Using state:district format
✅ **Perfect mapping**: DISABLED (had wrong geoIds)
✅ **Fallback mapping**: ACTIVE (should work for most districts)
✅ **District name mappings**: 164 special cases handled

## If Still Seeing White Districts:

Please share:
1. Screenshot of the map
2. Screenshot of browser console
3. Copy of console messages (especially the debug output)

This will help me identify if it's a caching issue or a logic issue.
