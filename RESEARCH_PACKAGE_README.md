- Space for notes and findings

### 3. all-districts-statewise.txt
**Reference:** Complete list of 741 districts from government API

### 5. frontend/public/india-districts.geojson (Optional)
**Advanced:** Full map file with all details
- Only needed if you want to find exact geoIds
- Can search for district names
- Contains coordinates and boundaries

## Quick Start

1. **Read** `RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (5 minutes)
2. **Open** `DISTRICTS_NEEDING_RESEARCH.md` (main work file)
3. **Start with HIGH PRIORITY** districts (1-8)
4. **For each district:**
   - Google the district name
   - Check if state is correct
   - Find correct GeoJSON name in `geojson-districts.json`
   - Fill in the checkboxes
5. **Submit** your completed research

## Priority

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (Do First!)
**Districts 1-8** - These might be showing WRONG data RIGHT NOW!
- Estimated time: 30-45 minutes
- These are critical for accuracy

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Districts 9-42** - Not showing on map, but could be added
- Estimated time: 1.5-2 hours
- These improve coverage

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY
**Mystery 12 districts** - Need to identify first
- Can skip for now

## Common Patterns You'll Find

### Pattern 1: Wrong State ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Example:** API says "Narmadapuram, Gujarat" but it's actually in Madhya Pradesh
**Action:** Note the correct state and find the district in that state

### Pattern 2: Renamed District
**Example:** API says "Kawardha" but GeoJSON has "Kabirdham"
**Action:** Find the new name in GeoJSON

### Pattern 3: Spelling Variation
**Example:** API says "Beed" but GeoJSON has "BID"
**Action:** Try different spellings when searching

### Pattern 4: New District
**Example:** "Bajali, Assam" created in 2020, might not be in GeoJSON
**Action:** Mark as "NEW DISTRICT - NOT IN GEOJSON"

## Tips for Fast Research

1. **Use Ctrl+F** to search in geojson-districts.json
2. **Try variations:** If "Beed" doesn't work, try "Bid", "BEED", "BID"
3. **Check Wikipedia** for official district information
4. **Google Maps** to verify state
5. **Mark uncertain ones** and come back later

## What We'll Do With Your Research

Once you complete the research:
1. We'll update the mapping file with correct information
2. Add verified districts to the map
3. Exclude districts that don't exist in GeoJSON
4. Achieve **100% accuracy** on the district map!

## Questions?

If you get stuck:
- Mark the district as "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH"
- Add notes about what you found
- Move to the next one
- We'll review together

## Estimated Time

- **HIGH PRIORITY (1-8):** 30-45 minutes
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY (9-42):** 1.5-2 hours
- **TOTAL:** 2-3 hours

## Goal

üéØ **100% Accuracy** - Every district must map to the correct location!
