## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Ground Truth Establishment
- Extracted 735 unique API districts
- Extracted 749 unique GeoJSON districts
- Found 575 exact matches (78.2%)

### Phase 2: Intelligent Matching
- Used known government name variations
- Applied similarity algorithms
- Found 73 additional high-confidence matches
- Identified 45 medium-confidence matches

### Phase 3: Finalization
- Auto-approved all high and medium confidence matches
- Marked 34 districts as excluded (new districts not in GeoJSON)
- Generated production-ready mapping file

## Files Generated

1. **frontend/src/data/perfect-district-mapping-v2.json** - Production mapping file
2. **analysis-output/validation-report.json** - Detailed validation report
3. **analysis-output/perfect-mapping-v2-final.json** - Backup copy

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Frontend Code

Edit `frontend/src/components/IndiaDistrictMap/MapView.jsx`:

```javascript
// Change this line:
import perfectMapping from '../../data/perfect-district-mapping.json';

// To this:
import perfectMapping from '../../data/perfect-district-mapping-v2.json';
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
