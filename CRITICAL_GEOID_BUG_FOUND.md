# üö® CRITICAL BUG FOUND: Wrong GeoIDs in Manual Fixes!

## The Problem

The manual fixes I added to `generate-perfect-mapping.js` have **WRONG geoIds**!

### Example:
```javascript
'bengaluru|karnataka': { 
  geoDistrict: 'BENGALURU URBAN', 
  geoState: 'KARNATAKA', 
  geoId: 106  // ‚ùå WRONG! This is actually Wanaparthy, Telangana!
}
```

**Correct geoId**: 81 (not 106)

## Impact

**24 GeoJSON districts are showing WRONG data** because multiple API districts are mapping to the same (wrong) geoId:

### Critical Cases:
1. **WANAPARTHY (Telangana) [geoId: 106]** ‚Üê Getting data from 6 Bangalore variants!
2. **VELLORE (Tamil Nadu) [geoId: 79]** ‚Üê Getting data from both Vellore AND Nellore!
3. **PRATAPGARH (UP) [geoId: 29]** ‚Üê Getting data from both UP and Rajasthan!
4. **SINDHUDURG (Maharashtra) [geoId: 107]** ‚Üê Getting data from Bangalore Rural!

## Root Cause

When I added manual fixes in `scripts/generate-perfect-mapping.js`, I included geoIds without verifying them against the actual GeoJSON. I just guessed the IDs!

## The Fix

**Remove all manual fixes with geoIds from `generate-perfect-mapping.js`**

The manual fixes should ONLY be in `districtNameMapping.js` for name normalization. The perfect mapping should be generated automatically from the analysis, which will get the correct geoIds from the GeoJSON.

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Remove manual fixes from `generate-perfect-mapping.js`**
2. **Keep only name mappings in `districtNameMapping.js`** (already correct)
3. **Regenerate the perfect mapping** without manual geoId overrides
4. **Let the analysis script find the correct geoIds** from GeoJSON

## Why This Happened

I tried to add manual fixes too quickly without verifying the geoIds. The geoIds need to come from the actual GeoJSON file, not be manually specified.

## Current Status

‚ùå **BROKEN**: 24 districts showing wrong data due to incorrect geoIds
‚úÖ **Name mapping**: Working correctly in districtNameMapping.js
‚úÖ **Analysis**: Correctly identifies the issues

## Recommendation

**DO NOT USE THE CURRENT PERFECT MAPPING FILE!**

It has wrong geoIds that cause districts to show data from completely different districts in different states.

The application should rely on:
1. **districtNameMapping.js** for name normalization (working correctly)
2. **Fallback lookup with state:district format** (working correctly)
3. **NO perfect mapping** until it's regenerated with correct geoIds
